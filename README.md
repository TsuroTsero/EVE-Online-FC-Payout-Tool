2. Download **Python 3.9 or newer**
3. Run the installer

**IMPORTANT:** During installation, check the box:
> ‚úÖ "Add Python to PATH"

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Open PowerShell or Terminal

cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\fcpayout
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Install Required Python Packages

pip install playwright pyperclip requests
```

These packages are used for:
- `pyperclip` ‚Äì copying in-game mail text to clipboard
- `requests` - gets character ids from the esi

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Run the Tool

To launch the FC payout GUI:

```bash
python FC_Payout_Tool_v2.0.py
```

You will be able to:
- Enter Buyback ISK amount
- Import pilots in bulk from br.evetools.org by going to report ---> composition ---> chars and copying pilots including their photo and name.
- Import pilots in bulk by name with a list of names each on its own line.
- Import pilots from a fat link by copy pasting the names (can and likely will include the system and ship they were in when they clicked the link. These will be ignored)
- Mark scouts and exclude pilots from payout

## üß† Optional Fix for Linux Clipboard

If `pyperclip` doesn‚Äôt work on Linux, install `xclip`:

```bash
sudo apt install xclip
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional: Build a Standalone Executable (.exe)

To convert the script to a portable `.exe` file:

1. Install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Build your `.exe`:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "playwright-browsers;playwright-browsers" FC_Payout_Tool_v2.0.py
```
OR

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole .\FC_Payout_Tool_v2.0.py
```

Make sure `playwright-browsers/` is copied next to your `.exe`.
